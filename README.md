# Worldlist Maker

This project allows you to generate wordlists based on numbers or characters. It provides options to create wordlists with different combinations and variations.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `Number.java`: Contains the implementation for generating number-based wordlists.
- `Character.java`: Contains the implementation for generating character-based wordlists.
- `App.java`: The main application file where the user can choose the type of wordlist to generate.

## How to Run

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
2. Compile the Java files using the following command:
3. Run the compiled program using the following command:
4. Follow the prompts and enter the required information to generate the desired wordlist.

## Generating Number-based Wordlist

The `Number` class provides functionality to generate wordlists based on numbers. When running the program, select the option for number-based wordlist generation. You will be prompted to enter the start and end numbers for the wordlist. The program will create a wordlist file containing numbers between the specified range.
can you used to generate Wifi passwords,pin passwords and more.

## Generating Character-based Wordlist

The `Character` class generates wordlists based on characters. When running the program, select the option for character-based wordlist generation. You will be prompted to enter various details such as firstname, lastname, company name, age, etc. The program will combine these details in different ways to create a wordlist file.

## File Output

The generated wordlists will be saved as text files in the same directory as the source code. If you want to change the output directory, you can modify the `path` variable in the `character` class.
